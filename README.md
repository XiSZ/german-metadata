# german-metadata

A js package for easy consumption of german metadata such as phone prefixes and city names in german language with given special characters.

# Usage

```
npm install german-metadata
```

## City objects

The german meta data package is based on an array that consists of single city objects and a set of functions that allows to query them. Here is a basic city object sample for Frankfurt am Main. If a functions states to return a city object, this is what you will get.

```json
{
  "name": "Frankfurt am Main",
  "prefix": 69,
  "normalized": {
    "name": "frankfurt_am_main"
  }
}
```

## Samples

```js
const germanMetadata = require('german-metadata');

// get city by phone number, phone number does not need to be prepared
// output will be a city object for Frankfurt am Main
const cityForNumber = germanMetadata.getCityByPhoneNumber('069472111');

// get city by phone prefix, prefix must be a number without leading 0
// output will be a city object for Munich
const cityForPrefix = germanMetadata.getCityByPhonePrefix(89);

//get phone prefix by city name, city name must be a string
// output will be a number
const phonePrefixByCity = germanMetadata.getPhonePrefixByCityName('Frankfurt am Main');

// get the specific number only prefix for a non cleaned phone number
// output will be 69 as number
const prefixForPhoneNumber = germanMetadata.getPrefixOfPhoneNumber('069472111');

// validate if a city name is valid
// output will be true
const isValidCityName = germanMetadata.doesCityExistWithName('Frankfurt am Main');

// normalize city names,
// output will be a normalized city name string
const validCityName = germanMetadata.normalizeCityName('Frankfurt am Main');


// normalize phone number,
// output will be a normalized phone number as string
const validPhoneNumber = germanMetadata.normalizePhoneNumber('069472111')


//This gives access to the original cities data being used
const cities = germanMetadata.cities

```

# Functions

## find entries in data

### `getCityByPhoneNumber(phonenumber)` -> `Object:City`

This function takes a phone number as input and returns the corresponding city object. The input phone number is normalized before the lookup.

### `getCityByPhonePrefix(prefix)` -> `Object:City`

This function takes a phone prefix (area code) as input and returns the corresponding city object.

### `getPhonePrefixByCityName(cityname)` -> `Number:Prefix`

This function takes a city name as input and returns the phone prefix (area code) associated with that city. The input city name is normalized before the lookup.

### `getPrefixOfPhoneNumber(phonenumber)` -> `Number:Prefix`

This function takes a phone number as input and returns the phone prefix (area code) of that phone number. The input phone number is normalized before the lookup.

### `doesCityExistWithName(cityname)` -> `Boolean`

This function takes a city name as input and returns true if the city exists in the data set. The input city name is normalized before the lookup.

## Helper Functions

### `normalizeCityName(cityname)` -> Returns string representing a normalized city name

Expects a city name as string without any further preparation and normalizes it to a standard, comparable, format being all lowercase, no space, no special character version of the city name.
Characters will be replaced with given schema: `Ää` -> `ae`, `Öö` -> `oe`, `Üü` -> `ue`, `ß` -> `ss`, ` ` -> `_`, `.` -> `__`, `-` -> `___`

- `normalizeCityName("Berlin")` -> `berlin`
- `normalizeCityName("München")` -> `muenchen`
- `normalizeCityName("Fürstenberg Havel")` -> `fuerstenberg_havel`
- `normalizeCityName("Bergholz-Rehbrücke")` -> `bergholz___rehbruecke`

### `normalizePhoneNumber(phonenumber)` -> Returns a number representing a normalized phone number

Expects a phone number in any known german format as string without any further preparation and normalizes it to s standard, comparable, format
Every character that is not `0`,`1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9` as well as leading `0`'s or leading country code `49` are removed.

- `normalizePhoneNumber("+49 (0) 4171-492482")` -> `4171492482`
- `normalizePhoneNumber("07171492482")` -> `7171492482`
- `normalizePhoneNumber("0049671-492482#433,222")` -> `671492482433222`

### `cities` -> `[{...}]`

This allows direct access to the data that is used by this package and returns the contents of `cities.json` which represents an array of cities.
